## CompuNet's Approach

We understand our clients' business needs and engineer IT solutions to solve those needs on time, and on budget. Our mission is to design, test, deploy, and support the right IT solutions for each customers‚Äô most vital business goals. üî•

## What Makes Us Different

### Engineers, not "pre-sales" and "post-sales"
- At CompuNet our engineers aren't pigeon holed into just "pre-sales" or just "post-sales" roles, instead they engage with customers throughout the entire project life-cycle.
- This model means that all of our engineering team's invaluable deployment experience is brought to the forefront of every engagement, ensuring our clients' are being delivered solutions that work in the real world ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è (j/k that's not actually trademarked, but it'd be cool if it was, huh?).


### Right Sized for Clients, And for CompuNet
- A side-affect of our engagement model is that we need to be selective in what technologies we put in our tool-belt üß∞. This means we won't position solutions we aren't intimately familiar with, because if our engineers position it, they are also committed to delivering it for our clients'.


### We're Picky And You Should Be Too!
- We spend a lot, perhaps too much(!), time evaluating new technologies ‚è≤Ô∏è. We bring the lessons learned from this time to our clients' to help map the right products and solutions to their business needs.
 

### How We Engage üíç
- We don't want to just sell you things, we want to partner with you. Our goal is always to become a valued extension of our customer's internal teams.
- We spend time to ensure that we can integrate as seamlessly as possible into our customers internal processes so we can take as much operational burden away as we can, while still providing consistent communication, visibility, and efficiency!
