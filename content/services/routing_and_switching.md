Good ol' route/switch -- this is our bread and butter ðŸŽ¯, it's how this whole CompuNet thing got its start!

From the traditional route/switch we know and love -- BGP, ISIS, OSPF, DMVPN, etc. etc., to more contemporary technologies like VXLAN with MP-BGP (or multicast, why not) control plane, or SRv6 networking is still, and will always be, one of our core competencies and favorite things to do!
