SDWAN is its own category here rather than being in "route/switch" because this is a barrel of fun all on its own now!

There are about 10 trillion SDWAN offerings out there now. We know, because we've had to deal with a good chunk of them! When our clients are dealing with shopping for an SDWAN solution, or just managing one they already have, we bring our extensive experience to the table in any way we can.
