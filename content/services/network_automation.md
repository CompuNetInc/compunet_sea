Network automation for us is centered entirely around free and open-source software, mostly in the Python üêç and Go ecosystems.

Automate your network *responsibly* -- we believe if it isn't documented, tested, and in a pipeline, it isn't ready for production. Our goal within the automation practice is to help clients embrace open source and do so in a responsible fashion that sets them up for success in their automation endeavors.
